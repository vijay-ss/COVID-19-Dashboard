# COVID-19-Dashboard Web App

This interactive dashboard is aimed at providing users with a daily summary of the global situation on Covid-19. It is intended for those seeking a concise breakdown of the numbers, without the constant news updates. There is also a snapshot for Canadian cases, and can be expanded to other regions in the future as necessary.
